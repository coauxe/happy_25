    <p class="marquee">25 years ago today, Nelson Mandela was released from prison<br><br><br> 
    The 40th NBA All-Star Game was played. East beat West 130-113<br><br><br>
    Todd Eldredge won the US Figure Skating championship<br><br><br>
    James "Buster" Douglas KOs Mike Tyson to win the heavyweight crown<br><br><br>
    But the most important event of that day was, without a doubt, the birth of you<br><br><br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQwQnEfbh0U" target="_blank">Shaun Ephraim Mejia</a><br><br><br><br><br>
    You've had my back since the days of chimichangas, tight jeans and late-night debauchery<br><br>
    And know you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzY9a-WmE6o&t=2m46s" target="_blank">"ride my tail anytime"</a> <br><br>
    Ever since the fourth grade, we've been more or less a package deal.<br><br> Honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way <br><br>
    It's a testament to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL4L4Uv5rf0"target="_blank">our friendship</a><br><br>
    A lot of people would kill <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB4X_wS-tRw" target="_blank">for it</a><br><br>
    So, drink up, man. You deserve to celebrate your life because, honestly, you brighten up the lives around you.<br><br>
    Have fun in the Motherland and make some awesome fucking memories.<br><br>
    And to quote John Dryden, here's to
     "a very merry, dancing, drinking,
	laughing, quaffing, and unthinking time."</p>
